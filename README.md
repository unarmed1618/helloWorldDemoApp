# HelloWorld demo app
An application demonstrating my abilities as a software engineer. 

I designed this app using Node.js (relying on express.js for routing) MongoDB, JadeLang as a markup intermediary, jquery for flavor, and Bootstrap for aesthetics. 

## File structure:
**web.js** - Primary application entry point, and routing handler.  
**models.js** - Data model definitions live here, as well as other elements of the model.  
**/static** - Files that need to be statically accessed live here. (Bootstrap, jquery, etc).  
**/pages** - Jade pages live here and get rendered as needed by the application.  
**/pages/shared** - Elements that need to be shared between all pages (partials, header, includes) live here.
